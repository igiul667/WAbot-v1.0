## Requirements
The install script should install everything, but python3 is needed. To install follow the official [guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

Then enter the repository and make the install.sh executable

`cd WAbot-v1.0`

## Running it
To start the bot run this (once inside WAbot-v1.0)
`node main.js`

The wabot directory contains the python scripts used to execute bot functions.

Once the install script is ran, it generates a file: <setting.set>
It is a text file in UTF-8 encoding containg the following data:
| Line | Content                                                                                                   |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    0 | path to wabot directory (ending with '/')                                                                 |
|    1 | language to use for TTS and messages (only valid if the adequate .lan file is inside languages directory) |
|    2 | the command to call python (added for future compatibility with windows where the command is "python")    |
